abstract: "This paper analyzes marriage data in Toronto over the last decade, highlighting trends in marriage rates, average age at first marriage, and seasonality. Using data from the Open Data Toronto, we apply statistical methods to explore how economic conditions and cultural diversity influence these trends. The study provides insights into the changing matrimonial landscape in Toronto, useful for policymakers and social researchers."

# Introduction

You can and should cross-reference sections and sub-sections. We use @talia, @opendatatorotno, and @rohan.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. @sec-mydatasection



# Data {#sec-mydatasection}

Some of our data is of penguins (@fig-marriage), from @palmerpenguins.

```{r}
#| label: fig-marriage
#| fig-cap: Bills of penguins
#| echo: false

data |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = marriage_licenses)) +
  geom_point()

```

Talk more about it.

And also planes (@fig-planes). (You can change the height and width, but don't worry about doing that until you have finished every other aspect of the paper - Quarto will try to make it look nice and the defaults usually work well once you have enough text.)
